# Essence Team assessment
Reflecting on our current state, we would think that we are in the **Collaborating** state and need to evaluate on mutual trust and open/honest after we have worked together more, but initial estimates seem positive.

## Seeded and Formed
All of the points here are mostly pre-defined due to our school enviroment. Adn the rest were coverd in the initial meeting that we held. You can refer to our "Meet the group" turn in for detials. We feel confident that we are past the **Seeded state**.

The same can be said for the **formed state** and what is not inherent to our colaboration as students has been talked about in an initial meeting for every assignment and divided up in tasks in order for members to keep track of. We are therefore confident that we are past the **Formed state**.

## Collaborating
We do not meet most points in the collaboration state, its to early to confidently say that we know and trust each other and are communicating open and honestly. We are however on good way to be working as a cohesive unit, although we might have to work to build a rapport with eachother in order to diffinitley say we match this. All team members are focused on achieving the team mission. We therefore feel like we are currently in the **Collaborating state** and need to further evaluate our mutual trust and open/honesty as we work more together.

## Performing
We are meeting some of the points in performing mainly identifying and adressing problems without outside help. We are still doing some avoidable backtracking and reworking and wasted work which is something we can hopefully adress with the experience we gatherd from this current assignment.
